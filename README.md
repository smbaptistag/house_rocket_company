# HOUSE ROCKET COMPANY

House Rocket is a digital platform whose business model is based on buying and selling real estate.

To facilitate the analysis of existing assets, an interactive application was created that allows, through dashboards and tables, to consult relevant information and extract insights.
To build this application, **Streamlit** (open source application framework) was used and it was deployed on cloud **Render**.
